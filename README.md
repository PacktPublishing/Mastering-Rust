# Mastering Rust
This is the code repository for [Mastering Rust](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-rust?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785885303), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
If concurrent programs are giving you sleepless nights, Rust is your go-to language. Being one of the first ever comprehensive books on Rust, it is filled with real-world examples and explanations, showing you how you can build scalable and reliable programs for your organization.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The book will appeal to application developers who would like to build concurrent applications with Rust. Basic knowledge of Rust is assumed but not absolutely required.

To really dive into the content of this book, you should write out the example code and solve the exercises. For that, you’ll need a fairly recent computer: 1 GB of RAM should be enough for the purposes of this book, but the more you have the faster the builds will be.

Linux is the best-supported operating system here, but Rust itself is also a first-class citizen on macOS and recent versions of Windows, so all the examples should adapt well there.

There are no code files for Chapter 15.

The code will look like the following:
```
fn main() {
    println!("Are you writing this or reading it?");
}
```
